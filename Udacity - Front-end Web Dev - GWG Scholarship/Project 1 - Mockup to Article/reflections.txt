You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

  I've done some HTML writing before, so this is all review. It's the JavaScript
later that won't be. I'd say, if I've applied what I'd consider actual skills in
the first lesson, it's going from a mockup to an actual web page. The Slack has
been interesting, but I'm not entirely sure that it's helpful at the admittedly-
early point I'm at right now.

  It's been really easy converting the markdown to actual HTML, though figuring
out what some tags are called or how they're formatted is occasionally annoying.

  There hasn't really been many challenges in the lessons so far, other than
figuring out what the long line on the bottom was supposed to be. That was just
simple documentation research in the MDN.
