			<p>A fennec fox is a small nocturnal fox native to the Sahara, Arabian desert, and Sinai Peninsula. They are the smallest member of both the genus <em>Vulpes</em> and the broader family <em>Canidae</em>, though their status in <em>Vulpes</em> is a matter of debate. They are omnivorous, feed on insects, birds, and small mammals, and they are hunted by eagle owls, jackals, and striped hyenas. They mate for life and travel in packs.
